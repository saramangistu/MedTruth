This project focuses on detecting and classifying medical misinformation on social media using NLP.  
It uses real-world datasets (COVID19-Fake-News, PubHealth, HLR) to train models that classify health claims as true or false.

## 🔍 Goal
Build a binary classifier to identify health-related fake news and support evidence-based public communication.

## 📊 Datasets
- [COVID19 Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/covid19-fake-news-dataset-nlp)
- [PubHealth Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ersindemirel/pubhealthdataset)
- [HLR/Misinformation-Detection](https://github.com/HLR/Misinformation-Detection/tree/main)

## 🧠 Models
