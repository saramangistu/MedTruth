# üß¨ MedTruth: Detecting Medical Misinformation on Social Media

This project aims to detect and classify **true vs. false health-related claims** in the style of **social media posts** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **large language models (LLMs)**. The solution combines real-world labeled datasets with synthetically generated claims via GPT-4-Turbo to improve model generalization and robustness.

---

## üéØ Goal

- Build a robust binary classifier to detect **false medical claims** on social media.
- Evaluate performance on both **real** and **synthetic** data to simulate noisy, casual online text.
- Leverage **LLMs** (BERT-based) and compare with **baseline models**.

## üì¶ Datasets

### üß™ Real datasets:
- [COVID19 Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/covid19-fake-news-dataset-nlp)
- [PubHealth Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ersindemirel/pubhealthdataset)
- [HLR/Misinformation-Detection](https://github.com/HLR/Misinformation-Detection)

Only samples labeled as `True` or `False` were used.

### üß† Synthetic dataset:
- 2,300+ **synthetic false claims** were generated using **GPT-4-Turbo** via Azure OpenAI.
- Prompts were primed with COVID-related false claims to guide generation of realistic, misleading, and casual health misinformation across diverse topics.

---

## üß¨ Dataset Fields

### üìÑ All training and evaluation datasets share the following structure:

| Column  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claim` | Text of the medical or health-related claim (real or synthetic) |
| `label` | Ground-truth classification: either `True` or `False` |

üß† **Note**:  
The file `final_GPTclaims.csv` contains only **synthetic false claims** that passed a quality score threshold.  
It does **not** include a `label` column since all samples are implicitly labeled as `False`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Models

### üîπ Baseline Models
- **TF-IDF + Naive Bayes**
- **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**

### üîπ Transformer-Based Models
- **BERT**
- **BioBERT**
- **RoBERTa**

All transformers were trained using HuggingFace `Trainer` on the merged dataset (real + synthetic).

---

## üìà Evaluation

All models were evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

Evaluations were performed on a stratified test split from the combined dataset.

> üî∏ Note: Baseline models were trained on real data only.  
> üîπ Advanced models were trained on **real + synthetic data**.

## üß™ Results Summary

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Naive Bayes         | 0.77     | 0.78      | 0.75   | 0.75     |
| Logistic Regression | 0.78     | 0.78      | 0.76   | 0.77     |
| BERT                | 0.867    | 0.865     | 0.872  | 0.869    |
| BioBERT             | 0.860    | 0.862     | 0.859  | 0.860    |
| RoBERTa             | **0.875**| **0.874** | **0.879** | **0.876** |

> üîπ RoBERTa achieved the best overall performance.  
> üî∏ Baseline models struggled more with recall on the minority class ("False").

## üöß Limitations and Future Work

- The synthetic dataset was generated using GPT-4-Turbo without expert medical validation. Future work could include manual annotation or filtering by healthcare professionals.
- The current classification is binary (`True` / `False`). Incorporating a stance-aware or multi-class labeling scheme (e.g., "misleading", "partially false", "unverified") may improve granularity.
- All content is in English. Multilingual support could expand the applicability to global misinformation detection.
- Model evaluation was performed on balanced test sets. Real-world data may be skewed and require further adaptation strategies.
